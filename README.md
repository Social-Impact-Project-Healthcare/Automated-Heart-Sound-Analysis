# Automated-Heart-Sound-Analysis

Welcome to the Heart Sound Analysis Automation project, a part of the Societal Impact Project Programme for Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors.

## Overview
This project focuses on creating a comprehensive resource that delves into the automation of heart sound analysis. With a foundation in the study of over 50 years, our project aims to provide valuable insights and knowledge through a series of blogs and thoroughly researched content.

## Project Objectives
Educational Content: Our project aims to educate and inform about the automated classification of pathology in heart sounds.

## Methodologies: Explore various methodologies used in heart sound analysis, including artificial neural network-based approaches, support vector machines, hidden Markov model-based approaches, and clustering-based approaches.

## Disease Prediction: Develop a solution capable of predicting heart diseases with up to 90% accuracy, including Mitral Stenosis (MS), Mitral Regurgitation (MR), Aortic Stenosis (AS), Aortic Regurgitation (AR), and Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP).

## Solution
Our solution leverages state-of-the-art techniques and methodologies to predict heart diseases accurately. The diseases included in the prediction model are Mitral Stenosis (MS), Mitral Regurgitation (MR), Aortic Stenosis (AS), Aortic Regurgitation (AR), and Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP). The accuracy of our solution is demonstrated to be up to 90%.
