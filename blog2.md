## How to tackle the problem using automated heart sound analysis

CVD diagnosis can be done by using the widely known auscultation methods based on 
stethoscope, phonocardiogram, or echocardiogram. A cardiologist expert could use 
phonocardiogram (or PCG) to visualize the recorded heart sound during a cardiac cycle 
based on a phonocardiograph device . Also, they can use an echocardiogram (average 
cost of 1500 as per current cost ) to visualize the heart beating and blood pumping. 
Using a stethoscope, the cardiologist listens to the patient heart sound and tries to find 
out clues of unusual heart sound (murmurs), which is symptomatic of cardiac 
abnormalities. The recorded heartbeat sounds different between a normal heart sound 
and an abnormal heart sound as their PCG signal differs significantly from each other 
with respect to time, amplitude, intensity, homogeneity, spectral content, etc. 
Roughly, all of these heart screening procedures are expensive and require a lot of 
experience. As stated previously, auscultation requires an experimented cardiologist to 
obtain an accurate diagnosis . According to some research, medical students and 
primary care physicians can reach only 20 to 40% accuracy in the heart screening 
process , and roughly 80% can be achieved when conducted by expert cardiologists . In 
other words, there is a lack of a reliable solution for earlier diagnosis of CVDs.
Developing an accurate, accessible, and easy-to-use solution enables the 
democratization of the early heart screening, which can significantly help patients to 
stabilize or even to heal cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the PCG heart screening is 
considered a high-potential research topic that will expand and develop in the near 
future . Many of the existing research work generally focuses on automatic cardiac 
auscultation based on classical machine learning methods and deep learning models 

## Alternative Methods

In clinical research, statistical algorithms in ML provide an effective way to analyze 
large datasets. Health centers generate huge data daily. ML algorithms need a vast 
amount of data to generate effective findings to provide significant information and 
immediate health results to patients. The significance of ML in health is that it 
processes large datasets beyond the scope of human ability and provides better 
health to patients at a lower cost.

ML is described as part of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in which a model acquires 
knowledge from past experience, without being explicitly programmed. Medical data 
are used in different ML classifiers for classification or forecasting of diseases. 
Supervised learning, which requires labelled input data for training the machine, is 
employed, and the machine learns with features called biomarkers of heart disease. 
Patient data are fed to the machine, and labelled outcomes are obtained. There are 
different ML classifiers for building data analysis models such as random forest, K-NN, 
and MLP. The main objective of each classifier is to build a model with exceptional 
disease detection capability.
ML algorithms can improve efficiency, reliability, and accuracy in the outcomes 
obtained. Logistic regression on respiratory disease, generalized linear models, and 
Poisson regression were implemented to analyze mobile radiation the human body 
and on COVID-19 datasets, and k-means clustering on brain tumors. The statistical 
methods of ML shed light on the results of pathology data and assist pathologists. 
DL algorithms such as artificial neuron networks to diagnose diabetic retinopathy 
and deep convolutional neural networks for fetal ultrasound are explored. The 
chapter also describes You Only Look Once, Region Based Convolutional Neural 
Networks (RCNN) masking, and fully convolutional network algorithms for brain 
tumors in DL to detect objects in various fields.
For results of the exploratory analysis, ten feature selection techniques, i.e., ANOVA, Chi-square, mutual information, ReliefF, forward feature selection, backward feature 
selection, exhaustive feature selection, recursive feature elimination, Lasso regression, 
and Ridge regression, and six classification approaches, i.e., decision tree, random 
forest, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and Gaussian 
naive Bayes, have been applied to Cleveland heart disease dataset. The feature subset 
selected by the backward feature selection technique has achieved the highest 
classification accuracy of 88.52%, precision of 91.30%, sensitivity of 80.76%, and f-score of 85.71% with the decision tree classifier
